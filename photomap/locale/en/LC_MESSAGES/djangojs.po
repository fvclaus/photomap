"<p> Hi there! I sense you must be new to KEIKEN since you have no albums, yet. "
"Therefor you might appreciate a quick introduction to you newly created photoalbum! </p>"
"<p> I'll start by explaining the page as you see it right now. There is a header with the KEIKEN-Logo "
"and the page-title (which is the album-name in the Albumview). At the very bottom of the page there is a footer with quite a lot of links "
"pointing to more or less interesting pages. Naturally the KEIKEN-Team would appreciate it, if you take a look at the "
"<a href='/payment'>donation page</a>. ;) Besides those links there is your user-menu (left side). "
"You can use it to logout or change your settings. </p>"
"<p> Between header and footer is the most important part of the page. Since this is your Dashboard you have a "
"big map on which you can view all your albums and add as many new ones as you like. Once you add an album by clicking "
"on the coordinates you want to connect your album with or doubleclick on an existing album you will get redirected "
"to its Albumview. There you can add places, and photos and view all your pictures and descriptions in a gallery, a slideshow "
"or in fullscreen! <br /> If you want to edit albums (or places and photos for that matter) move your mouse over the marker/thumbnail and choose "
"whether you want to edit or delete the album. </p>"
"<p> Once you have an album with places and pictures you can share it with others. For that select 'Share' in the "
"control panel of the album (mouseover! ;) ) and follow the instructions given in the dialog. If you share it <strong>for the first "
"time</strong> you need to define a password. Then give the url and the password to your friends and family so that they can view your "
"work! </p>"
"<p> Well I don't want to bore you with talking too much - I'm sure you are eager to try KEIKEN yourself and show "
"all your friends and family the experiences you made. Enjoy and don't hesitate to ask if there are any problems! </p>"
"<p> For more information on KEIKEN and a short tutorial/FAQ check our "
"<a href='/help'>help page</a> or <a href='/contact'>contact the KEIKEN-Team</a>. </p>"
"<p style='font-size: 0.7em'> You can close this message by clicking on it. It'll automatically open again once you "
"move your mouse out of the map (onto header or footer). </p>"
