"<p> Hi there! I sense you must be new to KEIKEN since you have no albums, "
"yet. Therefor you might appreciate a quick introduction to you newly created "
"photoalbum! </p><p> I'll start by explaining the page as you see it right "
"now. There is a header with the KEIKEN-Logo and the page-title (which is the "
"album-name in the Albumview). You can click on the logo to return to the "
"dashboard, when you are logged in. At the very bottom of the page there is a "
"footer with quite a lot of links pointing to more or less interesting pages. "
"Naturally the KEIKEN-Team would appreciate it, if you take a look at the <a "
"href='/payment'>donation page</a>. ;) Besides those links there is your user-"
"menu (left side). You can use it to logout or change your settings. </p><p> "
"Between header and footer is the most important part of the page. Since this "
"is your Dashboard you have a big map on which you can view all your albums "
"and add as many new ones as you like. Once you add an album by clicking on "
"the coordinates you want to connect your album with or doubleclick on an "
"existing album you will get redirected to its Albumview. There you can add "
"places, and photos and view all your pictures and descriptions in a gallery, "
"a slideshow or in fullscreen! <br /> If you want to edit albums (or places "
"and photos for that matter) move your mouse over the marker/thumbnail and "
"choose whether you want to edit or delete the album. </p><p> Once you have "
"an album with places and pictures you can share it with others. For that "
"select 'Share' in the control panel of the album (mouseover! ;) ) and follow "
"the instructions given in the dialog. If you share it <strong>for the first "
"time</strong> you need to define a password. Then give the url and the "
"password to your friends and family so that they can view your work! </p><p> "
"Well I don't want to bore you with talking too much - I'm sure you are eager "
"to try KEIKEN yourself and show all your friends and family the experiences "
"you made. Enjoy and don't hesitate to ask if there are any problems! </p><p> "
"For more information on KEIKEN and a short tutorial/FAQ check our <a href='/"
"help'>help page</a> or <a href='/contact'>contact the KEIKEN-Team</a>. </"
"p><p style='font-size: 0.7em'> You can close this message by clicking on it. "
"It'll automatically open again once you move your mouse out of the map (onto "
"header or footer). </p>"
