"you can use numbers and symbols in your password and it indeed makes your "

"initial letters of the the first lines of the children song 'Kookaburra', "
"transform all the 'i's into 1 and also take the punctuation -> 'Ks1togt.M,mkotb1h.' "
"and you get a fairly safe password, which on top of that is easy to remember. The "
"only problem might be that it takes a while to type, so in case you don't like "
"that, you should maybe consider taking a 4-word password, as described above. Of course "
"this was just an example - we used it, cause many people know this rhyme; when creating "
"your own password you should also create your own rhyme, if you don't want people to guess "
