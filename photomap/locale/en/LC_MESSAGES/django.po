"make sure you can easily remember the password for your own convenience. "
"Another way to make strong passwords is to use mnemotechniques. Eg. take the "
"initial letters of the first lines of the children’s song 'Kookaburra', "
"transform all the 'i's into 1 and also take the punctuation -> 'Ks1togt.M,"
"mkotb1h.' and you get a fairly safe password, on top of which, it is easy to "
"remember. The only problem might be that it takes a while to type, so in "
"case you don't like that, you should consider taking a 4-word password as "
"described above. Of course this was just an example - we used it, because "
"many people know this rhyme; when creating your own password you should also "
"create your own rhyme, if you don't want people to guess it. In case you "
